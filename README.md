An Hour Challenge
=====

I just thought it might be fun if we try build some things in an hour.
Sometimes from scratch. Sometimes from some basic project.

Rules
-----

- Commit single readme file with specification of your objective.
- Code that's been committed in one hour from first commit will be your result.
  - If you commit first readme commit at 10:00 and commit complete working code at 11:01, zero code is your result.
- No restriction about number of commits; commit as much as you like and as much as possible to keep your result up to date.
